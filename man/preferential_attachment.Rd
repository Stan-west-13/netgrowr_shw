\title{Compute preferential attachment values}
\usage{
preferential_attachment(net, known, weighted = FALSE, alpha = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{net}{A binary adjacency matrix.}

\item{known}{A vector of known vertexes. Can be a logical vector.}

\item{weighted}{Logical. Should weights be taken into account?}

\item{alpha}{What proportion of the growth value should be influenced by the
weight [1]? This is ignored if \code{weighted} is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A vector of growth values for unknown words.

Words that are flagged as \code{known} in the input will be associated with
\code{NA} in the output.

Children acquire words that are related to high-degree words that they
already know.

Growth value is the mean degree of the known words that the new word
attached to [2].
